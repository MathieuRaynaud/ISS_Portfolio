              <h4 class="blue">Internship in software development</h4>
              <p> In my formation at INSA, I had to make an internship of at
                least 8 weeks at the end of my fourth year.<br>
                This internship, I decided to do it in a foreign country.
                Consequently, I made some researches, and I finally found one in
                Germany, in the city of Regensburg. There, I worked for <a href="https://www.avl-functions.com/en/">AVL
                Software and Functions</a>, which is a company which
                works on automotive. AVL is known for its production of test
                benches for engines, but it also produces calculators, electric
                engines, etc. and works with all the motorized sectors (trucks,
                cars, trains, ships, etc.).<br>
                The AVL group includes at least 9.500 employees worlwide, and more than 500 employees only in Regensburg.<br/>
                <br>
                During 12 weeks, I led a project alone, helped by two tutors and
                some colleagues. This project was the creation of an application
                able to monitor the progress of a project in the company.<br>
                <br>
                During this internship, I started by discovering the existing
                Excel tool used by the company, the one that I had to
                "transform" into an user-friendly software. Then, I studied the
                existing technologies I could use to develop my software, and I
                designed it. Finally, I developed a complete Java EE application
                communicating with a MySQL database.<br>
                <br>
                The application works as following: when a project manager wants
                to create a new project, it enters its parameters (size, budget,
                level of security needed, etc.) in the application, and this one
                creates a page in which are registered all the documents
                required for the project.<br>
                Depending on the project parameters, the documents required are
                different, and the state of the project changes when the project
                manager adds or removes documents from the application.<br>
                At the end, projects are reviewed by quality engineers, and can
                be accepted or rejected. Some CSV documents can also be exported
                with the data stored in the database.<br>
                <br>
                At the end of my experience, I gave a working solution which is
                completely usable by the company to lead all its projects.<br>

              <h4 class="blue">Microcontrollers and Open-Source Hardware (MOSH)</h4>
              <p> For the course of Microcontrollers and Open-Source Hardware,
                our objective was to study and design a Printed Circuit Board
                (PCB). This PCB implements a 2-levels trans-impedance amplifier
                which gets 110nA in input and gives 1.1V in output.<br>
                This PCB was designed to be plugged on an Arduino Uno and to use
                the <a href="#gassensor">gas sensor we produced later</a>.<br>
                We started by designing the trans-impedance circuit with an
                electrical scheme which is the following one: </p>
              <div id="image"> <img id="myImg" src="images/transimpedance_kicad.png"

                  alt="Electrical scheme of the PCB" style="width:30%" onclick="openModal(this)">
                <!-- The Modal -->
                <div id="myModal" class="modal">

                    id="targetImg">
                  <!-- Modal Caption (Image Text) -->
                  <div id="caption"></div>
                </div>
              </div>
              <ul>
                In the scheme above:
                <li>R5, at the entry, protects the operational amplifier against
                  electrostatic discharges</li>
                <li>R5 and C1 constitute a filter against voltage noise</li>
                <li>C1 and R1 form a filter against current noise</li>
                <li>R2 can be changed to adapt the calibre of the amplifier</li>
                <li>C4 and R3 constitute an active filter</li>
                <li>C2 and R6 filter the output</li>
                <li>C3 filters the supply noise</li>
              </ul>
              <p> Then, we reported the scheme on the KiCad software, and we
                designed the routes between all the electrical components to
                obtain the following 2D view of the PCB: </p>

              </div>
              <p> Finally, we associated each electrical component to its 3D
                view, and we generated the 3D views of our PCB: </p>

              <h4 class="blue">Energy efficient future wireless communications</h4>
              <p> On December the 19<sup>th</sup>, 2018, I assisted to a
                conference given by profesor Nuno Norges Carvalho from the
                University of Aveiro, in Portugal. Profesor Nuno Borges Carvalho
                is IEEE Fellow and IEEE Distinguish Lecturer, and the topic of
                the conference he gaved was: "Energy efficient future wireless
                communications".<br>
                It was a really interesting conference in which he explained
                what will be the next technologies used in wireless
                communications.<br>
                Currently, the main problem in wireless communication is energy
                cosumption. In fact, we build smaller and smaller devices which
                are able to communicate with the Internet, but the reduction of
                the size of these devices leads to the reduction of the size of
                batteries they bring.<br>
                Consequently, future technologies to communicate will be
                technologies for which moving devices will consume very few
                resources or no resources at all to communicate, and will need
                to interact with a lot of fixed devices electrically supplied.<br>
                This is the poster of the conference of Profesor Nuno Borges
                Carvalho at INSA on December the 19<sup>th</sup>, 2018: </p>

              <p> All semester long, and with four colleagues (Erwan Béguin,
                Wael Ben Jemaa, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-baptiste-laffosse/"

                  title="Join Jean-Baptiste on LinkedIn" target="_blank">Jean-Baptiste
                  Laffosse</a>, <a href="#" title="Visit Alex Noize portfolio"

                  target="_blank">Alex Noize</a>), I worked on the development
                of a network of smart weather stations inside the La Massane
                forest in Banyuls-sur-mer, in the south of France.<br>
                <br>
                At the beginning, the researchers of the oceanological
                observatory of Banyuls-sur-mer monitored the forest manually by
                visiting the protect area once a month to take some measurements
                on several points. The objective was to study the behaviour of
                the forest when it faces extreme weather conditions (like heat
                waves for example). <br>
                <br>
                The solution we developed for this project works with connected
                weather stations communicating in LoRa with a Gateway. These
                weather stations implement four sensor: temperature, humidity,
                luminosity and ozone sensors. Once the data is collected by the
                gateway, it is sent to The Things Network (a cloud for LoRa data
                on the Internet). Then, this data is automatically collected by
                a NodeJS server, and displayed on client side by an AngularJS
                dashboard.<br>

              <h4 class="blue">Merckathon of the Oceanological Research Center
                of Banyuls-sur-Mer</h4>
              <p> The Merckathon of Banyuls-sur-Mer is a Hackathon organized
                since 2017 by the oceanological research center of Banyuls and
                the INSA of Toulouse.<br>
                During two days, the 50 students of the INSA Innovative Smart
                Systems formation work on a subject they choose. The only
                direction is to create an innovative smart module useful for the
                research center. </p>
              <p> During this Merckathon, I worked with four of my colleagues.
                We chose to deploy a module to plug on the divers of the
                research center, and able to automatically take some
                measurements in the sea during the dive. The objective was to
                make useful the time during which the divers are in the sea to
                take measurements and increase the quantity of data collected by
                the research center. </p>
              <p> The solution we implemented used an Intel Edison with a
                temperature sensor, a pressure sensor, and an ultrasonic ranger
                sensor. </p>
              <p> Here is a scheme which explains the way of working of our
                system: </p>

              <ul>
                In the picture above, we can see several elements:
                <li>The diver, on the bottom, carries the smart module on his
                  back which takes automatically measurements on the water at
                  his position</li>
                <li>The boat and the two buoys compute the position of the diver
                  using ultrasounds waves and triangulation</li>
                <li>The boat and the two buoys determine their own position by
                  GPS to be able to give the GPS position of each measurement
                  taken</li>
              </ul>
              <p> On software side, I developed a dashboard using Node.js and
                the framework express to develop a web-oriented application.
                This one is able to extract the measurements done by the diver
                module from a CSV file, and display them on a Google Maps API.
                Each measurement is located by a pin at the relevant position
                which contains the information collected at this point. </p>
